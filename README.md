# INTRODUCTION
## [Airline Passenger Satisfaction](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground)
Customer satisfaction scores from 120,000+ airline passengers, including additional information about each passenger, their flight, and type of travel, and their evaluation of different factors like cleanliness, comfort, service, and overall experience.

In this project, I used SQL to extract, manipulate, and analyze airline passenger satisfaction data. The goal was to provide airlines with valuable information that would help enhance their services and increase passenger satisfaction levels.
